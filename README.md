# IN-DISH-ISIVE

An app made for those who routinely find themselves debating on what or where to eat.

## About the Project

The idea for this project arose from an all too-relatable situation that many of us face daily. That is, deciding what or where to eat either for ourselves or debating the choice with another. This project sets out to resolve that issue by taking the decision out of the user's hands. Using In-DISH-isive, the user can add or delete any number of food options that will be stored and visible in the sites UI. Once an adequate list has been compiled, the user can then have the dish choice be choosen and displayed for them by one click of the "randomize" button. Simple and easy to use, the hope is that this application can relieve some stress off those out there that tend to have a hard time making that final decision on their next meal.
